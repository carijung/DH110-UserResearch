## Description of Project 
### design challenge, 

The UN Environmental Programme website is a highly resourceful envioronment-advocating site that aims to build a liason between humans and nature. It provides information about their mission to protect our ecosystem through combinations of articles, videos, informational pages, and resources for users to get involved. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I believe the user interface(UI) of the UNEP website can overwhelm users, especially first time users, due to their extensive information. I believe redesigning the UI by restructuring the navigation bars and the flow can make the site more approachable and help users locate specific informations on sustainable communites more efficiently. Also, I hope to improve the limitations in user control and freedom present in signing up for updates and no autofill suggestions in search bars.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


The target users for the user research will be extremes of any demographic who have access to internet and are interested in gaining more nsights on sustainablity goals and the environment. Users will acquire low to mediocre expertise on sustainability and have not previously used the website. Users will be asked to explore the website and locate specific information on Sustainable Cities and Communities. 

### research method
The qualitative research method for this research will be covert observation + active interaction. 

### user activities,

This research will be conducted via Zoom. I will be observing how to user navigates the site, their behaviors, and facial expressions. After instructing them about their end goal, users will soley navigate the website on their own (guidance or translation will be provided if requested). The data will be collected via voice/video recording and pen-paper notes. 

First, I will ask the user broad questions like their age, whether they have a passion to gain knowledge on sustainability, and their skill level in utilizing online platforms. Then, I will ask deeper questions like what makes them passionate and what they hope to gain from the website in hopes to gain an understanding of their ambition.
