## Description of Project 
### design challenge, 

The UN Environmental Programme website is a highly resourceful envioronment-advocating site that aims to build a liason between humans and nature. It provides information about their mission to protect our ecosystem through combinations of articles, videos, informational pages, and resources for users to get involved. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I believe the user interface(UI) of the UNEP website can overwhelm users, especially first time users, due to their extensive information. I believe redesigning the UI by restructuring the navigation bars and the flow can make the site more approachable and help users locate specific information more efficiently. 
Also, I hope to improve the limitations in user control and freedom present in signing up for updates and no autofill suggestions in search bars.

### target users, 
Step02: Target users (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.44-51)
What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 




### user activities,
Step04: Plan the details
Brainstorm the right contexts and narrow down to decide where to visit physically and/or virtually (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.52-55)
Decide what activities to observe
Decide how to interact with the users (ex. overt x participatory if it is contextual inquiry)
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the (interview + observation) guide (p.41)

### research method(s)
Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods) 
by covert / overt observation
by active / passive / participatory interaction * 
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO, p.39-42)
