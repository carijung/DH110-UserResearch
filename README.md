# Assignment 3: User Research
Cari Jung • DH110 • Fall 2022

##  ✅ Step 1: Design Challenge 
The UN Environmental Programme website is a highly resourceful environment-advocating site that aims to build a liason between humans and nature. It provides information about their mission to protect our ecosystem through combinations of articles, videos, informational pages, and resources for users to get involved. 

I believe the user interface(UI) of the UNEP website can overwhelm users, especially first time users, due to their extensive information. I believe redesigning the UI by restructuring the navigation bars and the flow can make the site more approachable and help users locate specific informations on sustainable communites more efficiently. Also, I hope to improve the limitations in user control and freedom present in signing up for updates and no autofill suggestions in search bars.

## ✅ Step 2: Identify target users
* Demographics: extreme users (left end of spectrum) of any demographic 
* Preferences: users will have access to internet and have the desire to learn more about sustainability related issues.
* Expertise: users will acquire low to mediocre expertise on sustainability, technology, and have not previously used the website. 

## ✅ Step 3: Research Method
The qualitative research method for this research will be overt observation + participatory interaction. This research will be conducted via Zoom. As a moderator, I will be observing how to user navigates the site, their behaviors, and facial expressions. After instructing them about their end goal, users will soley navigate the website on their own (guidance or translation will be provided if requested). The data will be collected via voice/video recording.

## ✅ Step 4: Plan the details

### Observation
> There are several language options, but user's primary language (Korean) was missing. Users were confused and found it hard to navigate the site as it had too many resources as well. However, the animated videos helped them visualize the issue and they thought other users can benefit from the resourcefulness. 

> Residing in an area where homelessness, littering, and bad air quality, are pressing issues, the user wants to look for more resources to help ameliorate them to help create a better community. 

> User achieved end goal of finding the sustainability goals by chance. While exploring the page, the user clicked on a random article which had a chart of sustainability goals underneath. (time stamp)


## ✅ Step 6: Reflection
Due to sustainability being a universal goal, I wondered how extreme users who are not familiar with using technology but had access to it would interact with a website. Therefore, I decided to interview a user who met these standards and also required translation. This research was a valuable experience as I got to interview a generous user who was willing to contribute their time to this lengthy process and because I learned about the fundamentals of engaging with extreme users. Learning about their background helped me understand what features this digital product should potentially implement in order to remove limitations that may be preventing them from engaging with the resources. Although I had the translations for the interview questions prepared, I did find trouble translating jargon present in the website. As a mainstream user, this made me wonder about how much larger the obstacle must feel for many extreme users. The user took longer than they had expected to complete each task because they aren't fluent in English (they are a Korean speaker). However, I waited for them to ask me for guidance instead of reaching out to them first like how I have during the pilot usability testing. Overall, this resarch prompted me to want to interview more users to design a product that can be catered to a wider range of users.
